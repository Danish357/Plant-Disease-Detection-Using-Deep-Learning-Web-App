# Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-Web-App
Photos of leaves from various plants are taken with a digital camera or similar unit, and the images are used to classify the affected region in the leaves. To detect plant disease, we use a Convolution neural network and a Deep neural network in the proposed framework.
